              <p>KING HENRY V - Act 3, Scene 1:  
              Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
              Or close the wall up with our English dead.
              In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
              As modest stillness and humility:
              But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
              Then imitate the action of the tiger;
              Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
              Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
              Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
              Let pry through the portage of the head
              Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
              As fearfully as doth a galled rock
              O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
              Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
              Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
              Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
              To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
              Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
              Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
              Have in these parts from morn till even fought
              And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
              Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
              That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
              Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
              And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
              Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
              The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
              That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
              For there is none of you so mean and base,
              That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
              I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
              Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
              Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
              Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'</p>

              <p>KING HENRY V - Act 4, Scene 3:  
                What's he that wishes so?
                My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
                If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
                To do our country loss; and if to live,
                The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
                God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
                By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
                Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
                It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
                Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
                But if it be a sin to covet honour,
                I am the most offending soul alive.
                No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
                God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
                As one man more, methinks, would share from me
                For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
                Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
                That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
                Let him depart; his passport shall be made
                And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
                We would not die in that man's company
                That fears his fellowship to die with us.
                This day is called the feast of Crispian:
                He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
                Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
                And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
                He that shall live this day, and see old age,
                Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
                And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
                Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
                And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
                Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
                But he'll remember with advantages
                What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
                Familiar in his mouth as household words
                Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
                Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
                Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
                This story shall the good man teach his son;
                And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
                From this day to the ending of the world,
                But we in it shall be remember'd;
                We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
                For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
                Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
                This day shall gentle his condition:
                And gentlemen in England now a-bed
                Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
                And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
                That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.</p>

              <p>KING HENRY V - Act 4, Scene 1:  
                Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
                The greater therefore should our courage be.
                Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
                There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
                Would men observingly distil it out.
                For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
                Which is both healthful and good husbandry:
                Besides, they are our outward consciences,
                And preachers to us all, admonishing
                That we should dress us fairly for our end.
                Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
                And make a moral of the devil himself.</p>
